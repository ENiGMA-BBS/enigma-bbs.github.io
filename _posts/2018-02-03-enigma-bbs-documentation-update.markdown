The ENiGMA½ BBS documentation has been completely overhauled! You can now find it in its own sub-site of the 
GitHub repo here - [ENiGMA½ BBS Documentation](https://nuskooler.github.io/enigma-bbs).

As the docs are hosted on GitHub if you see something missing or incomplete, submit a pull request with an 
update!
