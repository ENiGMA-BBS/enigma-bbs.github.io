The easiest place to start is with the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/NuSkooler/enigma-bbs/issues). Your
issue may have already been solved on a newer version, or someone may have experienced a similar issue!

A few ENiGMA SysOps hangout on IRC: **#enigma-bbs** on chat.freenode.net. If you don't have an IRC client, you
can also access this via the freenode [web interface](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=enigma-bbs).
 
Alternatively, there is a lot of active BBS discussion on [fsxNet](http://bbs.nz/#fsxNet), which is available on many 
popular boards.
